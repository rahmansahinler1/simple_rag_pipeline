Plug -in \\nhybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs ), whic h are a sub -class of \\nHEVs , provide lower fuel consumption and exhaust gas \\nemissions thanks to their e xternal charging and higher range \\nof electric drive capabilities . Therefore,  they are  increasingly \\npopular in the automotive i ndustry  nowada ys. To make a  \\nrapid assessment of th e cont rol or the ene rgy management \\nstrate gies applied to a PHEV , the generation of a  vehicle \\nmodel has a crucial  role.  This paper propose s a rapid -\\nresponsive, data -driven, kinematic, and map -based PHEV  \\nmodel  in a Python environment . Approxima tely 2000 km of \\nreal-world vehicle measurements w ere used  instead  of \\ndriving cycles , which enables a wide range of driving \\nmaneuvers to be used  for modeling  and testing purposes . \\nResults  of the v ehicle model were compared in two \\ncategories to express the charge -sustaining  (CS) and charge -\\ndepleting  (CD) behaviors of the mo del. \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\nHybrid electric vehicles  (HEVs ) consist ing of two energy \\nconverte rs, generall y an internal co mbustion engine (ICE) as a \\nprim ary energ y converter and one or mo re electric motor  (EM)  \\nas seconda ry energy co nverters , are nowada ys one of the m ost \\npromising  solution s for not only environmental  pollution but \\nalso fu el eco nomy [1]. Compared to HEVs, plug-in hybrid \\nelectric veh icles (PHEVs) provide lower fuel co nsumptio n and \\nexhaust gas emission  thanks to their external cha rging and \\nhigher ran ge of electric driv e capabili ties [2]. Although there are \\nseveral powertrain topolo gies of PHEVs  in the industry , parallel \\ntype-2 (P2) architecture  is one of  the most used  architectures \\ndue to its increased energy recuperation potential and the \\navailabilit y of additional hybrid cont rol functions . Therefore, a \\nP2-type PHEV is used for modeling  purpo ses in our study . \\nP2 ar chitecture  permits separate or combined  traction from \\nICE and EM based on the driver's  request . Thus,  torque \\ndistribution between ICE and E M is a substa ntial topic and is \\nmostly studied  under  the tit le of  energy m anagement . Energy \\nmanagement strategies in the literature are mainly classified into \\ntwo categories: rule-based  and optimization -based methods . \\nRule -based approaches are class ified into two sub -categories: \\ndeterministic and fuzzy. Optimization -based methods, on t he \\nother hand, are divided into global, real -time, and local \\nstrategies  [3]. Global optimizati on-based methods such as \\ndynamic programming (DP) or the Pontryagin minimi zation \\nprinciple (PMP)  cannot be used in real -time or fa st-respon se \\nrequired applications due to their computational comple xity. \\nHowever, rule -based  methods as well as  real-time and local \\noptimiz ation-based methods namely , equivalent consumption minimizati on strategy (ECMS) , adaptive -ECMS (A-ECMS) , \\nrobust control (RC) , and artificial intelligen ce (AI) based  energ y \\nmanagement strateg ies are useful for real-time or fast-response \\nrequired application s [4]. \\nApart from vehicle models, energy management strateg ies \\nare a lso developed for various type s of vehi cles. For instan ce, an \\nenerg y management str ategy  is developed  for a fuel cell electric \\nvehicle us ing model -based reinforce ment lear ning with data-\\ndriven  model updates  in MATLAB  [5].

       " Document(page_content='Fig. 1. Block diagra m of the vehicle model \\nOur proposed  data-driven  vehicle model  aims to create \\nrepresentativeness of  a PHEV in various real-world driving \\nconditions.  To that attempt , we used a kine matic  approach \\nwhere th e input v ariables are the speed of the vehicle  in km/h  \\nand the grad e angle of the road  in % . Unlike most of the studies \\nmentioned above, our vehicle model was developed within a \\nPython environment using object -oriented program ming. W e \\nchose to use the Python environment for two main reasons: its \\nobject -oriented capabilities provide a rapid response, a nd it \\noffers powerful frameworks for machine learning projects that \\nwill be the basis of our future work. In particular, our model ca n \\nevaluate 2000 seconds of veh icle data in just 3 -5 seconds. This \\nefficiency surpasses many models in the field, including rule-\\nbased approaches as given by [2].  \\nReal-world maneuvers with urban, rural, and highway \\ncharacteristics were used to create a map -based vehicle model. \\nInstead of constructing a vehicle model that only relies on \\nstandard driving cycles, our aim is to mak e a vehicle model that \\nis built on real -world data and that can represent the state of \\ncharge ( SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors for m ost of the \\ncond itions such as CD and CS behaviors with acceptable \\naccuracy. This approach leads us to the primary contributions of \\nour wor k. The creation of a fast -responding vehicle model \\nwithin the Python environment which can be used in future \\nmachine -learning applica tions.  Also, a vehicle model design \\ncan be adapted easily for different hybrid vehicles with various \\npowertrain architectu res when the wide -ranging operational data \\nof the vehicle is available.   \\nThe rest of the paper is organiz ed as foll ows. In section 2,  the \\nutilize d data for the  modeling  and verification is mentioned. \\nSection 3 explains the vehicle modeling  approach .

During the  trips,  \\nthe chann els were recorded via Controller Area Network  (CAN) \\nbus with a 1 00 ms sampl ing time. In to tal, the amount of driv en \\ndistance  of the vehicle  is 1908 km which consists of  40.8% \\nurban  (0-60 km/h), 16.8% rural  (60-90 km/h) , and 42.8% \\nhighway  (> 90 km/h) distributions.

Vehicle  Mod elling Approach  \\n  \\nIn the paper , a data-oriented  vehic le model approach is \\npresented. Our main purpose is to obtain a fast-responding  \\nvehicle model w hich can be used in Python environment.  Since \\nthe vehicle model will be used in reinforcement learning -based  \\napplications  in future applications , the duration of  the result \\ngeneration  of the model is desired in seconds.

       " Document(page_content='4.1. Mode  Selection Strategy  \\n  \\nFor a mode  selection between electric and hybrid drive , a \\nstochastic  approach was implemented in the vehi cle model . The \\nresidency of th e hybrid and el ectric mode selection can be s een \\nin Fig. 2. Whil e ICE and EM operate  simultaneously in hybrid \\nmode  as three , only the EM operates  in electric mode  which is \\nexpressed as two. The numbers between two and three are the \\navera ge value s of the mode when t he veh icle operates in the \\nspecified  vehicle speed and accel eratio n region . The averag e \\nvalue increases  toward s three  when the vehicle speed and \\nacceleration increase . The frequency  of the  vehicle driven in \\nhybrid mode i ncreases when th e vehicle travels in rural  and \\nhighway maneuvers , which is a n expect ation that the efficiency \\nof the ICE is higher in moderate  engine speed  and to rque ar eas. \\nIn our stochasti c approach,  this observation was used as the \\nbaseline. The whole d ataset is grou ped with res pect to defined \\nSoC regions  from 0 % to 100% with 5 % incremental steps . For \\neach group , the reside ncy of the mode chann el is obtained and \\nthen the values b etween two and t hree are mapped between zero \\nand one to get the probability matrix. Finally,  the map \\ndistribution is a djusted as monoton ically increasing . The \\nprobability matri ces for two sam ple SoC re gions are show n in \\nFig. 3. The closer the value s are to  zero, the more frequent the \\nactivation of the electric mode.  In the f irst e xample , the  SoC \\nregion is selec ted between  25% and 30%.  Since the SoC va lue is \\ncloser to the lower limit , the more frequent hybrid mode \\nactivation especially in rural and highw ay d riving region s is \\nseen.  Contra ry to the first exa mple, the battery and there fore the \\nEM can be used mor e freque ntly in  this case.  That is why , the \\nmap generally expr esses zero values represen ting most ly electric \\nmode activation du ring e nergy management.  Just in rural and \\nhighwa y areas , ICE act ivation can also be seen  when the vehi cle \\ntravels steadily or with positive acceleration.  \\n  \\n4.2. Power Calculation  \\n  \\nAs for the power calculation, three maps were generated and \\nused to define the  necessary power ou tput from EM  and ICE in \\nthe rel evant driving conditio ns. All axes of the maps ar e the \\nsame and  while the x-axis repre sents the vehicle accelerati on \\naxis represent s the traction power with a range  between ±400 \\nkW with 25 kW incre ment and the z -axis represents the ICE  \\npower output in hybrid mode , EM power  output in hybrid mode \\nand EM po wer output in electric mode  in kW.  \\n \\n  \\nFig. 2. Residency of the mode selection in the comple te data \\n      Accordin g to the  selected mo de in the previous step, the \\nnecessary  power outpu ts will be obtained . Finall y, while  fuel \\nconsumption is calculated usin g the fuel co nsumption map of \\nthe vehicle , the remaining SoC is calc ulated using the  battery \\ncurrent map and the co ulomb counting approach . \\n  \\n5. Results  \\n  \\nThe vehicle model was implement ed with the data from  \\nvarious  driving  condition s. Since our modeling  methodology i s \\nbased on map definitions  through the data analytics of th e \\ngeneral veh icle behavio r and not specifica lly done for some \\nselected measurements , the complete data set with a travel \\ndistance of 1908  km is used in this section  instead of dividing  \\nthe measureme nts into modeli ng and testing groups.  In Table 1, \\nthe chara cterist ics o f the driving conditions  for urban, rural , and \\nhighway pro files are shown.  While t he average vehicle sp eeds \\nof CS measurements are 27. 2, 75.7 , and 117.3 km/h , the average \\nvehicle speed s of CD measurements are 27.9, 75.4, and 98.2 \\nkm/h  for urban , rural , and hi ghway profiles resp ectively . \\n(a)\\n(b)\\n-4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n-3.8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n-3.5 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n-3.3 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1', metadata={'source': '20230923_ELECO_Data-Driven-PHEV-Model.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

CS Mode Behavior  \\n  \\nOverall , 1159 km of vehicle data is used for CS mode \\nbehavio r analysis. As ment ioned in the energy management \\nstrategy sect ion, th e mode selection of the vehicle  depends on \\nthe output of the probabilisti c approach . Theref ore, three distinct \\nseed values  were used to run the vehicle model with the input  \\nsignals to take the randomness into account during the testing of \\nthe model . \\nThe actual average fuel consumption  as we ll as the mod el \\nresults with different  seed values are expressed  in Table 2. The \\nactual average fue l consumption of the vehicle can be se en as \\n7.35 L/1 00km . On the  other hand, the average fuel co nsumption  \\nof the th ree model results is 6.75 L /100km. The deviation \\nbetween the model resu lts and t he actual fuel con sumption  is \\nshown as 8.2%.  \\nAs for the SoC v alidation  of the model, the average deviation \\nbetween the actual  SoC signal and the modeled  SoC signal was \\nconsider ed. For each model run, t he average de viation was \\ncalculated  as 1.83%, 1.96%, and 2.40% respectively . The mean \\nvalue of the  deviation s is 2.06%. In addition to the tabular \\nreprese ntation , a time-based dia gram can be seen for the CS \\nresult comparison  in Fig . 4. For the time-based  repres entation  of \\nthe comparison , one of th e longest traveled measurements  with \\nan average success o f the vehicle mod el on fuel consumption \\nand SoC modelin g is selected . In the sample  measurement, the \\nSoC of t he battery is between 1 0% and 16% for the model and \\nactual result.  \\nElectr ic and h ybrid mode distributio ns as well as fuel \\nconsump tion at the end of t he test ca n be seen in Table 3. It was \\nobserved that  while  the hybrid mode distributi ons form the \\nmajority of the energy managemen t outp ut, the electric mode \\ndistributions represent the minor part of t he mode  selection \\noutput  for both results  because of  the CS behavior  of the test .  \\nThe percentage deviation between the mode distributions is \\n48.9% and 11.1% for e lectric and h ybrid mod es respectively.  \\nSince the amount of  electric  distribution is around 10 % to 15% \\nfor both results, the percentage d eviation  is higher  when \\ncompared to the hybrid mode distribution.   \\n  \\nTable  2.

The percentage deviation  \\nbetween the mode distributions can be seen as 7.1% and 58.4% \\nfor electr ic and hy brid modes respect ively.  Since the amount of  \\nhybrid  distribut ion is around 10% to 15% for bot h resu lts, the \\npercentage d eviation  is higher , which does not  affect the fuel \\nconsu mption or SoC tra ce at thi s rate. As for the  fuel \\nconsumption and the S oC traces , the fuel consumption of the \\nvehicle model is 11% higher t han the actual fuel consumption . \\nBesid es, the mean and m aximum SoC de viations are 2.93% and \\n7.98% re spectively. Sin ce th e measurement char acteristic is \\nmore ef fective on the SoC of the b attery, t he mean  and \\nmaxim um deviat ions are higher when compared to the values in \\nthe CS test results.  \\n  \\n6. Conclusions  \\n  \\nIn this st udy, generating a fast-responding  vehicle model  in \\nPython environment was successfully developed . For that \\npurpose, a n objec t-oriented pro gramming str ucture with a data-\\ndriven and map-based modeling  approach  was combined with \\ndata a nalytics  methods  for the interpret ation  of real-world  data. \\nAccordin g to the results , the vehicle model can  evaluate up to \\n7000  seconds of test data within 10-15 se conds. Additi onally , \\nthe model can represent  fuel consumption and  SoC behavior s in \\nurban, rural , and highway driv ing conditions . Although  the \\navera ge fuel consumption and SoC de viations, which are around \\n10% and 5%  respectively,  seem  at hig her le vels when compared \\nto the studies in the litera ture, the main reason and the a dvant age \\nof this study is providing a huge amount of real-world maneuver \\nvalida tion of the model.  As for futu re work, the vehicle model \\nwill be used  in artifici al intellige nce-based predic tive energy \\nmanagement studies . \\n Table  5.

Block diagra m of the vehicle model \\nOur proposed  data-driven  vehicle model  aims to create \\nrepresentativeness of  a PHEV in various real-world driving \\nconditions.  To that attempt , we used a kine matic  approach \\nwhere th e input v ariables are the speed of the vehicle  in km/h  \\nand the grad e angle of the road  in % . Unlike most of the studies \\nmentioned above, our vehicle model was developed within a \\nPython environment using object -oriented program ming. W e \\nchose to use the Python environment for two main reasons: its \\nobject -oriented capabilities provide a rapid response, a nd it \\noffers powerful frameworks for machine learning projects that \\nwill be the basis of our future work. In particular, our model ca n \\nevaluate 2000 seconds of veh icle data in just 3 -5 seconds. This \\nefficiency surpasses many models in the field, including rule-\\nbased approaches as given by [2].  \\nReal-world maneuvers with urban, rural, and highway \\ncharacteristics were used to create a map -based vehicle model. \\nInstead of constructing a vehicle model that only relies on \\nstandard driving cycles, our aim is to mak e a vehicle model that \\nis built on real -world data and that can represent the state of \\ncharge ( SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors for m ost of the \\ncond itions such as CD and CS behaviors with acceptable \\naccuracy. This approach leads us to the primary contributions of \\nour wor k. The creation of a fast -responding vehicle model \\nwithin the Python environment which can be used in future \\nmachine -learning applica tions.  Also, a vehicle model design \\ncan be adapted easily for different hybrid vehicles with various \\npowertrain architectu res when the wide -ranging operational data \\nof the vehicle is available.   \\nThe rest of the paper is organiz ed as foll ows.

Introduction  \\n \\nHybrid electric vehicles  (HEVs ) consist ing of two energy \\nconverte rs, generall y an internal co mbustion engine (ICE) as a \\nprim ary energ y converter and one or mo re electric motor  (EM)  \\nas seconda ry energy co nverters , are nowada ys one of the m ost \\npromising  solution s for not only environmental  pollution but \\nalso fu el eco nomy [1]. Compared to HEVs, plug-in hybrid \\nelectric veh icles (PHEVs) provide lower fuel co nsumptio n and \\nexhaust gas emission  thanks to their external cha rging and \\nhigher ran ge of electric driv e capabili ties [2]. Although there are \\nseveral powertrain topolo gies of PHEVs  in the industry , parallel \\ntype-2 (P2) architecture  is one of  the most used  architectures \\ndue to its increased energy recuperation potential and the \\navailabilit y of additional hybrid cont rol functions . Therefore, a \\nP2-type PHEV is used for modeling  purpo ses in our study . \\nP2 ar chitecture  permits separate or combined  traction from \\nICE and EM based on the driver's  request . Thus,  torque \\ndistribution between ICE and E M is a substa ntial topic and is \\nmostly studied  under  the tit le of  energy m anagement . Energy \\nmanagement strategies in the literature are mainly classified into \\ntwo categories: rule-based  and optimization -based methods . \\nRule -based approaches are class ified into two sub -categories: \\ndeterministic and fuzzy. Optimization -based methods, on t he \\nother hand, are divided into global, real -time, and local \\nstrategies  [3]. Global optimizati on-based methods such as \\ndynamic programming (DP) or the Pontryagin minimi zation \\nprinciple (PMP)  cannot be used in real -time or fa st-respon se \\nrequired applications due to their computational comple xity. \\nHowever, rule -based  methods as well as  real-time and local \\noptimiz ation-based methods namely , equivalent consumption minimizati on strategy (ECMS) , adaptive -ECMS (A-ECMS) , \\nrobust control (RC) , and artificial intelligen ce (AI) based  energ y \\nmanagement strateg ies are useful for real-time or fast-response \\nrequired application s [4]. \\nApart from vehicle models, energy management strateg ies \\nare a lso developed for various type s of vehi cles.

The percentage deviation  \\nbetween the mode distributions can be seen as 7.1% and 58.4% \\nfor electr ic and hy brid modes respect ively.  Since the amount of  \\nhybrid  distribut ion is around 10% to 15% for bot h resu lts, the \\npercentage d eviation  is higher , which does not  affect the fuel \\nconsu mption or SoC tra ce at thi s rate. As for the  fuel \\nconsumption and the S oC traces , the fuel consumption of the \\nvehicle model is 11% higher t han the actual fuel consumption . \\nBesid es, the mean and m aximum SoC de viations are 2.93% and \\n7.98% re spectively.

      "1. S. Onori\n",
      "2. L. Serrao\n",
      "3. G. Rizzoni\n",
      "Question: What is the main contribution of the paper?\n",
      "Answer: The main contribution of the paper is the development of a data-driven vehicle model for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using real-world driving data. The proposed model is designed to be fast-responding and can represent the state of charge (SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors in various driving conditions, including city driving (CD), suburban driving (SD), and highway driving (HD). Unlike traditional modeling approaches that rely on standard driving cycles, the authors' approach uses real-world data to create a map-based vehicle model that can adapt easily for different hybrid vehicles with various powertrain architectures when wide-ranging operational data of the vehicle is available. The paper also presents a novel energy management strategy and shows the modeling results in section 5, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",
      "Question: What is the main cotribution of Python?\n",
      "Answer: The main contribution of Python in this study is its ability to handle complex data analysis and machine learning tasks. The authors used a data-driven and map-based modeling approach in Python to develop a fast-responding vehicle model that can evaluate up to 7000 seconds of test data within 10-15 seconds. This approach allows for the creation of a detailed model of the vehicle's energy consumption and SoC behavior, which can be used for predictive energy management studies in artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's object-oriented programming structure, along with its extensive libraries and tools, made it an ideal choice for this study. The use of Python allowed the authors to quickly develop and validate the model, as well as perform complex data analysis and machine learning tasks. Additionally, Python's ease of use and flexibility made it possible to integrate the model with other tools and systems, such as data analytics software, which is important for this type of study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Python played a crucial role in the development and validation of the vehicle model, and its ability to handle complex data analysis and machine learning tasks made it an ideal choice for this study.\n",
      "Question: What is the modeling strategy used in the paper?\n",
      "Answer: The modeling strategy used in the paper is a data-oriented vehicle model approach, which combines mathematical equations and data-driven map generation techniques to create a fast-responding vehicle model within the Python environment. The authors aim to obtain a vehicle model that can represent the state of charge (SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors for most driving conditions, including city driving (CD), suburban driving (SD), and highway driving (HS).\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, the authors used real-world maneuvers with urban, rural, and highway characteristics to create a map-based vehicle model. Instead of constructing a vehicle model that only relies on standard driving cycles, the authors aimed to make a vehicle model that is built on real-world data and can represent the state of charge (SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors for most driving conditions with acceptable accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed vehicle model consists of two inputs: vehicle speed in km/h and road gradient in%. These inputs are used with vehicle road load coefficients to calculate tractive power. In addition, the wheel speed was simply calculated from the vehicle speed and tire diameter. The SoC at the previous step and vehicle speed, as well as acceleration values at the current step, are also considered in the modeling process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors explain that by combining mathematical equations and data-driven map generation techniques, they were able to create a fast-responding vehicle model that can be used in Python environment. The approach allows for easy adaptation of the model for different hybrid vehicles with various powertrain architectures when wide-ranging operational data of the vehicle is available.\n",
      "Question: What is the future work?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the paper, the future work for the data-driven PHEV model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Adaptation of the vehicle model to different hybrid vehicles with various powertrain architectures. This can be done by using the wide-ranging operational data of the vehicle, which will provide acceptable accuracy in representing the state of charge (SoC) and fuel consumption behaviors for most driving conditions, including CD and CS behaviors.\n",
      "2. Machine learning applications: The proposed vehicle model can be used as a basis for future machine-learning applications, such as optimizing energy management strategies or predicting SoC and fuel consumption patterns based on real-time data from the vehicle.\n",
      "3. Expansion of the map-based vehicle model to include more driving cycles and scenarios: While the current paper focuses on urban, rural, and highway driving conditions, the model can be expanded to cover other types of driving such as stop-and-go traffic or hilly terrain.\n",
      "4. Improvement of the model's accuracy through further refinements of the data-driven map generation technique: As more data becomes available, the model can be fine-tuned to provide even better predictions of SoC and fuel consumption patterns.\n",
      "5. Integration with other systems: The proposed vehicle model can be integrated with other systems such as traffic management or autonomous driving systems, providing real-time data for optimizing energy management strategies or predicting traffic flow patterns.\n"
